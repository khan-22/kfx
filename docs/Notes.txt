Components that may be needed:

MeshComponent:
  ABOUT:
  A component which "renders" a mesh with a specific
  material (shader+texture).
  It only sends the request for the mesh to be drawn
  to the renderer.
  HOW?:
    Observer?
      It shouldn't necessarily be immediate, but
      the renderer could still queue up requests.
      There is a somewhat nice decoupling by not using
      a direct reference...
      Question is if the observer pattern helps here, or 
      if a message box should be used...
  
CameraComponent:
  ABOUT:
  A component which specifies a viewport onto which
  the scene will be rendered. It only sends a request
  to the renderer.
  
FpsControlComponent:
  ABOUT:
  The object looks around with the mouse, and moves in the
  direction of where the user looks with the WASD keys.
