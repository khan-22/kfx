>Resources:
	>Meshes:
		>Data:
			Vertices
			Indices
		>Use:
			Render
			Collision(?)

	>Textures:
		>Data:
			Pixels
			Type(2D/3D or Albedo/Metalness?)
		>Use:
			Render Materials (PBR Albedo+Metal...)
			Data (eg. Heightmaps)
			
	>Audio:
		>Data:
			Sound Buffer
			Positions+Velocity (Sources)
			
		>Use:
			Audio FX for env or player cues
	
	>Shaders:
		>Data:
			Source code
			(Process into accessible units such
			 as uniforms?)
		 
		 >Use:
			Render meshes and materials

>Constraint:		
	Separate game logic from rendering
	(Make a library?)
				
>Notes:
	Shaders, Meshes and Textures are inherently
	connected. How do I separate these without
	causing annoying performance deteriorating
	jumps through the code?
	
	>Solution 1:
		Load all resources into their own buffers.
		Let objects use components which in turn
		refer to these handles.
		Components could simply be data and contain
		no(?) logic. Might be harder than the typical
		setup, but it's data-oriented...
		
		GameObject has components. Fixed.
		GameObject has basic data (transform-component?).
		GameObject has a message-box.
		Component recieves a message-box from GO
		and places messages there. (ORDER MATTERS).
		
		(Warn me if a message isn't picked up that frame?)
		
		Components may also observe external systems?
		(Or every GO does and submits the data to
		 the components).
		Messages COULD perhaps be read-once-only,
		so only one component may use a message.
		This could be troublesome though.
		(Consider Audio and collision).
		
		>Subsystems:
			Do these fit into the component scheme?
			Components are data-less... So do they
			message these subsystems to do their thing,
			just as some subsystems may message GO's?
			
			>Input:
				Takes input and places them in a global
				Message-box. (Event-like system).
				Cmd-line?
				
			>Graphics:
				How do I handle this?
				Do I do basic functions?
				Internal or External scene graph?
				Render optimizations? (Quad-tree)
				Rendering lines for debugging?
				
			>Audio:
				Play sounds when told to?
